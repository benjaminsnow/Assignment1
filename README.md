Assignment 1
===========


### Background
This is the repository for the **'Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis'** course taught by @christophergandrud at the Hertie School of Governance.

> Style guide: We use Hadley WickhamÂ´s Style Guide from [r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html).

In our first assignment we use the core R data sets 'Orange' and 'Loblolly' and explore the growth of Orange and Loblolly trees over time.

### Loading data sets 'Orange' and 'Loblolly'
As indicated by the prefix 1_orange.R, 'Orange' is the primary data file and should be run first. By copying the commands into R, R will automatically run the commands set in the 2_loblolly.R file, as the first file is dynamically linked to the second.

### Data exploration
In the **Orange data set** we first explored the data set and its specifications. Then we ran summary descriptive statistics to explore the growth of Orange trees over time. We also created a function in R to find out the mean circumference of the Orange trees in the sample.

In the **Lobolly data set** we explored the data set and its specifications before we ran summary descriptive statistics to explore the growth of Loblolly trees over time.

> Note: We pair programmed this assignment together, so while pushes have been down on one computer, work was done collectively.
